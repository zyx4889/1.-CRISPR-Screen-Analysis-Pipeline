# 1. In Vitro CRISPR Screen Analysis for Identifying Synthetic Lethal Targets to MYC inhibitors
This repository contains the computational pipeline for analyzing genome-wide CRISPR screening data to identify synthetic lethal interactions with MYC inhibition. The pipeline combines MAGeCK and DrugZ analyses for robust hit identification.
## Key Findings
- Identified mitochondrial Complex I as key synthetic lethal target with MYC inhibition through unbiased, whole genome, CRISPR screen Analysis
- Revealed mitochondrial metabolic vulnerabilities in MYC-driven cancers 
- Demonstrated therapeutic synergy between MYC inhibitors and metformin (bioinformatics was validated in multiple in vitro and in vivo models)
